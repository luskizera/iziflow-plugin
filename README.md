iziFlow transforms structured textual descriptions of user flows into visual diagrams directly in Figma and FigJam, streamlining the design and documentation process.

## âœ¨ Highlights

* **Simplified Input:** Define your flows using an intuitive Markdown-inspired syntax, far more readable than JSON.
* **Automatic Generation:** Automatically convert your text into visual nodes (Start, End, Step, Decision, Entrypoint) and connectors with an organized layout.
* **Visual Consistency:** Applies standardized styles for different node types and connections.
* **Designer-Focused:** Designed to simplify flow creation, even for those with minimal coding experience.
